###DevHack: Write non-disposable code with friends.  
> Code challenges sites are cute but they are not good neither for building a portfolio or making something useful for yourself and your friends. - Abraham van Hodgenville

3. Find a team, create a waffle.io board and start hacking!

Tips:

* It's recommended that be the one who writes the first lines of code, even before getting a team.
