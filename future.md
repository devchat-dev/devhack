### What's _DevHack_?
DevHack is a monthly [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) run by [DevChat](https://devchat.devolio.com), where programmers of all abilities are encouraged to collaboratively design and code software.

The DevHack is typically themed and lasts for 2 weeks; usually running in the first 2 weeks of the month. At the end of the 2 weeks, the projects are judged, and the winners are awarded prizes!

If you're interested, further information is provided below, or you can head over to [#devhack](https://devolio-devchat.slack.com/messages/devhack) channel to come talk to us!  

### So, How Does it Work?
Ok, every month for the first 2 weeks of the month we start a new DevHack. Each month will have a different theme and set of criteria the judges will use to gauge the winners.

The week before the start of the DevHack we will announce the theme of the DevHack and open the sign-up process. This gives everyone a bit of to get organised, put teams together (if you have a team, you don't *need* a team but it's encouraged) and get some ideas flowing.

You will then have 2 weeks to write some software, in your language of choice, and then submit it to the judges.

All of the sign-up and submittal details will be on the monthly [DevHackers](https://github.com/devolio-devchat/devhackers) page.

During the next week the projects will all be judged against the categories for the topic of the month, and the winners will be announced.

### Can I Participate?
Absolutely! It doesn't matter whether you're a seasoned veteran or just starting out, whether you have an idea for a project or you would like to join a project, you can participate in the DevHack!

### Are There Any Rules?
Yes, but not many. We need a few simple rules to keep things fair:
* Projects must be started and completed within the designated timeframe;  
 *I think this one is pretty easy to understand, we don't want to see your CS thesis dumped into a new repo and submitted!*
* Please provide some instructions to the software;  
 *It doesnt have to be extremely detailed, just something for the judges to use so they know how to run your code and interact with it.*
* Malicious software will result in global bannings.  
 *I think this is fairly self explanitory, and there's really no excuse.*

Although not a rule, we do encourage (and perhaps reward ðŸ˜‰) skill diversity among teams. Ultimately the goal of this is to help each other grow and learn as programmers, so pick up a new developer and help them into the world of collaborative programming.

### Great! So, Where Do I Start?
To get stuck in with the action you should head over to our [DevHackers](https://github.com/devolio-devchat/devhackers) repository and check out the latest README. The DevHack runs each month, and we have a sign-up process managed over there.

You should also come visit us in [DevChat](https://devchat.devolio.com) to meet some of your future team mates!

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing you there!
